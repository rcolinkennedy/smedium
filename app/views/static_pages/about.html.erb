    <p>        
      About to start a new project, my co-founder and I wanted to mimic the signup/sign in process from <a href="http://medium.com">medium.com</a>, and then we thought their layout was awesome, and then... Well, one thing led to another and now you're looking at this little project.
      <br>
      Simply put, if smedium had existed, it would have saved us a good chunk of work, so we throught we'd build this and share with friends like you.
      It's a fairly simple Rails app (Rails 4.0.1, Ruby 2.0.0) built using <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Zurb's excellent Foundation 5</a> to help anyone jump start a project. It's extensible, nicely formatted, and fairly DRY. We kept it as simple as possible, by doing things like minimal User models and no javascript other than what's built into <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a>.
    </p>
    <h6 >Why smedium? It's a small version of Medium.</h6>

      So give it a shot; <%= link_to "Sign in with Twitter", '/auth/twitter' %> to check out how it works; if you dig it, you can <a href="https://github.com/rcolinkennedy/smedium/">check it out on GitHub</a> and be rocking and rolling after a fork and a clone.
